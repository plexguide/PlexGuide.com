NOTE 1: Do NOT EXIT this interface. Please standby for validation checks!

NOTE 2: Standing by for [$tempseconds] + 10 seconds per the set DNS delay
check! When complete, Portainer will be rebuilt! If that passes,
then we will rebuild the rest of the containers!

Did you know PG started in late 2016? Frusted by 76TB of 2TB HD's, there had
to be a way to push it all in the cloud! Starting off from a document known
as PlexGuide, this is where we are at now today! Plus traditional coders
are evil, so that's why we are as NOOB friendly as possible!

Standby! Enjoy the work? Please donate @ donate.plexguide.com!
