## Allow docker to run all commands without a password
docker        ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL

#
# Allow "ssh hostname sudo <cmd>" without -t (TTY) option,
# because some remote management tools such as Capistrano
# and Vagrant require it.
#
# IMPORTANT: The user must have "NOPASSWORD: ALL" because
# "ssh hostname sudo <cmd>" will show the password in clear.
# If not, you should run "ssh -t hostname sudo <cmd>" instead.
